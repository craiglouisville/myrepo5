Website / Project Title - Dividend Stocks 

Description
The Dividend Stocks website is designed for long-term investors focusing on dividend-paying stocks. Our philosophy is to achieve an 8% annual growth rate, inclusive of both growth and yield, by selecting stocks with this potential. By making sound investment decisions and adopting a long-term approach, investors can build a robust portfolio and enjoy living off dividends throughout retirement.

Dividend Stocks aims to assist individual investors in reviewing investments based on six key criteria to help them reach their retirement goals. While every great company may have off days, wise investors take note during these times. With thousands of stocks to choose from, we focus on the "sleep at night" stocks that can help you achieve your ultimate goals over time.

This site is in Stage 1 of development – next step will be to include the ability to add a weekly dividend post, a link for Past Posts and ability to purchase a Portfolio Tracker spreadsheet.  Site is basic so far - adding the API and getting the timestamp to work via JavaScript was challenging.
